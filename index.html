            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p>I've worked in IT for a few years. Working on imaging computers back in the day and working in disaster recovery to then help desk and desktop support. <br> My 3rd real job in IT, I was a Jr. Network Administrator learning about networks and servers as I went. <br> Fast forward a few years and I landed a job at HP as a Data Analyst, and really enjoyed it but found a lot of my skills slipping away.  I decided then, that I would like to go to college and gain some new skills. </p>

            <h3>NEW PATH</h3>
            <p>I'm currently going to school full-time at Collin College. I'm working towards an AAS in Web and Mobile Development.  I wanted to update my skills and learn things you can't necessarily learn on the job.  I've also been enjoying some college culture and became a member of the Society of Women Engineers.

           <br>Full Stack Developer is also an interesting career path. <br> I'm excited for what the future holds! </p>
